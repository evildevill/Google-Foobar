## Elevator Maintenance

### Solution Explanation of the code java:
- The `Elevator` class represents an elevator object with its version information. The `__init__` method initializes the elevator object by parsing the version string and storing the major, minor, and revision versions.

 - The `__lt__` method is defined to enable sorting of elevator objects based on their versions. It compares the major, minor, and revision versions in a specific order.

 - The `solution` function takes a set of elevator strings `l` as input.

 - It creates an empty list `els` to store the `Elevator` objects.

 - It iterates over each elevator string in l and creates an `Elevator` object for each string using the `Elevator` class constructor.

 - It sorts the `els` list of elevator objects using the `sort` method, which internally uses the defined comparison (`__lt__`) method to determine the sorting order based on versions.

 - Finally, it returns a list of elevator strings by extracting the `str` attribute from each elevator object in the sorted `els` list.

 - In the if `__name__ == "__main__":` block, two test cases (`l1` and `l2`) are defined and passed to the solution function. The results are printed using the `print` function.


### Solution Explanation of the code java:

 - The `Elevator` class represents an elevator object with its version information. The constructor parses the version string and initializes the major, minor, and revision versions.

 - The `compareTo` method is implemented as part of the `Comparable` interface to enable sorting of elevator objects based on their versions. It compares the major, minor, and revision versions in a specific order.

 - The `solution` method takes an array of elevator strings `l` as input.

 - It creates an empty array `els` of `Elevator` objects with the same length as `l`.

 - It iterates over each elevator string in `l` and creates an `Elevator` object for each string using the `Elevator` class constructor.

 - It sorts the `els` array of elevator objects using `Arrays.sort`, which internally uses the `compareTo` method to determine the sorting order based on versions.

 - It creates a new string array `finals` to store the sorted elevator strings.

 - It iterates over the sorted elevator objects in `els` and assigns their corresponding strings to the `finals` array.

 - Finally, it returns the `finals` array containing the sorted elevator strings.

 - In the `main` method, two test cases `l1` and `l2` are defined and passed to the `solution` method. The results are printed using `Arrays.toString()` to display the arrays.
